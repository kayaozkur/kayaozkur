ðŸ‘‹ Hi there! 

My name is Kaya and I'm a data analytics consultant. 

I have a strong interest in Data Science and Data Engineering, and I'm an avid user of the R programming language and SQL. 

In my current role, I use these tools to help clients extract insights from their data and make data-driven decisions. 

I'm excited to be a part of the GitHub community and to share and learn from others in the field.
